</div>

### Description

<<UPDATED>> This example shows how to connect and interact with the America Online Toc server. <</UPDATED>> Since Chad Cox first published the AIM code, we have been working on the code as a community. Various people have contributed. We're working towards a fully functional VB client.
 
### More Info
 
Note: This code is actually an AIM clone, and does not require AOL instant messenger to be installed. Not all features of the official client are supported, but using the included TOC_PROTOCOL.txt file you can add them if you wish.
